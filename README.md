Its not a full fledged front-end of [piped](https://github.com/TeamPiped/Piped) rather its just a working search page which plays the actual videos on the [official instance](https://piped.video/feed)
Because for the most of the time when searching for something in the official instance its either too slow or sometimes all the video thumbnails are just not there
